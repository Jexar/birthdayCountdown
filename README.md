# Birthday Countdown JavaScript Project

This is a simple JavaScript project that displays a countdown to your birthday.

## How to Use

To use the countdown, simply enter your birthdate in the format `MM/DD` in the input field and click on the "Countdown" button. The countdown will then display the number of days, hours, minutes, and seconds remaining until your next birthday.

If your birthday has already passed this year, the countdown will show the number of days until your next birthday next year.
